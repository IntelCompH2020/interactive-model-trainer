On the main menu, when you hover over the "**Word Lists**" item, two new options are getting revealed with the first one being "**Keywords**", linking to a table with all the available keyword lists.

##### Listing

There are some tools that can help you with finding and displaying all the information about the wordlists. Above the table, there is a text bar where you can search by the list name, and next to it there are some more filtering options. You can view them by clicking the "**Filter**" button.

The available filters for stopword and equivalence lists are the following:
- **By date:** By giving a date, you can filter based on the date the list was added or updated.
- **By creator:** By giving a user name, you can filter only the lists that belong to that user, if they are not set as private lists.
- **By you:** You can check the "Show only mine" option to only view your lists.

The information being presented in the table, can also be sorted. All the columns that can be sorted or are already sorted, have a corresponding indication on the right side of the column headers. By default, the table is sorted by date in descending order, meaning that the most recent items are getting displayed at the top. Only one sortable column can be used at a time. Also, some of the columns can be hidden or revealed using the **'gear'** button positioned at the right bottom of the table. When you click on it, all the available display columns will be there for you to select using checkboxes.

##### Details panel

When you click on an item, all the available details about it can be viewed on a panel that gets populated on the right side of the table, regardless of the columns you have revealed at the time. From there, you can perform some actions on the selected item, using the corresponding buttons on the top part of the panel. Keywords can be renamed, updated, cloned or deleted. Renaming and updating is performed using modals that popup when you click the buttons mentioned above. When you try to delete an item, you will be warned by another modal before you can actually perform the action.

For keywords, the available information is the following:
- **Name:** The name of the item, which can be edited on the rename modal.
- **Description:** A short description, which can be edited on the update modal.
- **Created / Updated:** The date in which the item was added or updated.
- **Creator:** The name of the user that added this item.
- **Location:** The location of the data file related to the item.
- **Access:** Shows whether the item is public to everyone or private. Access can also be set on the update modal.

##### Importing / Creating

Above the listing, on the left side of the filtering options there is a "**Add keywords**" button. When you click it, a menu pops up giving you all the available options for keyword creation.

There are three ways you can add keywords to the system.

###### **i)** Import from file

On the file import form, there is a "**Load File**" button. When you click it, you can select the file you want to import. Then, the name of the file gets populated, along with an overview of the words contained in it and the system location in which the file will reside when saved. If you see words populating the 'overview' box, it is a good indication that there is no problem with the file formatting and you can safely save it. You can view information about the correct formatting by clicking on the blue "**i**" button on the left.

###### iii) Merge existing lists

You can create a new list by merging existing ones. On the modal that opens, along with the name and a description for your new list, you can select one or more existing lists to merge from the table. You can also view the items of these lists by clicking the "**View list**" buttons on the "**Actions**" column. When ready, you can click the "**Merge**" button to save your list.
