On the main menu, when you hover over the "**Corpora**" item, two new options are getting revealed with the first one being "**Raw Corpora**", linking to a table with all the available raw datasets.

There are some tools that can help you with finding and displaying all the information about the corpora. Above the table, there is a text bar where you can search by the corpus name, and next to it there are some more filtering options. You can view them by clicking the "**Filter**" button.

The available filters for raw corpora are the following:
- **By date:** By giving a date, you can filter based on the date the corpus was added.

The information being presented in the table, can also be sorted. All the columns that can be sorted or are already sorted, have a corresponding indication on the right side of the column headers. By default, the table is sorted by date in descending order, meaning that the most recent items are getting displayed at the top. Only one sortable column can be used at a time.
